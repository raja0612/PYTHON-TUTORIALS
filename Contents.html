         <li>What is Python ?</li>
         <p>Python is a high-level,general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented,
            language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
            The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, 
            not from the snake. Python programmers are affectionately called Pythonistas, 
            and both Monty Python and serpentine references usually pepper Python tutorials 
            and documentation.

     <section><strong>Chapter 2 - Install Python</strong></section>
     <ol>
         <li>Steps to Install Python on your Local Machine</li>
          <p> Before make your hands dirty with python, please install Python on you local machine.
            Python software can be download  from 
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Download</a>.
        </p>
     </ol>
     <section><strong>Chapter 3 - Open Python Terminal</strong></section>
     <ol>
        <li>After Install Python , Open either command prompt If you are using Windows OS Computer or
            Open Terminal If youy are usin Mac OS Computer and Type python and hit enter,
            It will open Python interactive shell with  ">>>" symbol.
            Just type : 
            print('Hello World') and then press enter you will see output 
            Hello World
        </li>
        <p>You can execute any valid instructions on he interactive shell</p>
         <div class="myStyle">
            >>> 2+3
            5 
            >>> 2/2
            0
        </div>
        <p>Don't worry, If you haven't understand what's going on in the background. You will 
            undersatnd everything in later chapters , Please Hold your Horses. LOL. 
            we promise you, You will become best Pythonista.
        </p>
    </ol>
   <section><strong>Chapter 4 - Fundamentals</strong></section>
    <ol>
        <li>Every Python file has extension ".py" and we use command python filename.py  to run
        the code in that file.</li>
 
        <p>Create a file called HelloWorld.py and then below code in that file</p>
        <div class="myStyle">
            HelloWorld.py
            ---------------------- 

            print('Hello Python')
            print(1+2)
            print('Python is Awesome')
        </div>
        <strong>NOTE : Save the file and run the file using command python HelloWorld.py</strong>
        <p>Congrats...! You have started your journey to become Pythonista. Cheers...!
            Get a Coffee or Beer to celebrate.
        </p>

    <section><strong>Chapter 5 - Datatypes</strong></section>
    <ol>
        <p>Python Language has different data types. </p>
        <li>Numbers</li>
            <p>Number Data type is used to store the numeric values.The cool thing about python
                is , no need to define the data type when you declare the varaible.
                It creates the variable based on value is assigned to that variable implicitly.
              <div class="myStyle">
                Syntax:
                age  = 10
                Here age variable is created with Number data type.
                It's Cool right , isn't it?
             </div>
            </p>
        <li>String</li>
        <p> String is the Data type which is used for stroring String values.</p> 
        <div class="myStyle">
         Syntax:
         name = 'Learn Daily'
         Here language variable is created with String data type.
         </div>
        <li>List</li>
        <p>List is one of the flexible  data type in python langugae which is used to store the
            collection of different data type values. List is defined with sqaure brackets [],
            and it each element in it seperarted by comma.
        </p> 
        <div class="myStyle">
         Syntax:
            myList = [1, 'Python', 3.14]
            myList = ["a", 1, 1.3, "Python"] 
        
            print(myList)  # print whole list 
            print(myList[1])  # print 2nd element i.e 1 
            print(myList[1:3])  # print from 2nd to 3rd element in myList
            print(myList*2)
            
            myList2 = ['a', 2] 
         </div>
         
         <p><strong>NOTE: In Python, the elements in List data type can be updated.</strong></p>
         
        <li>Tuple</li>
        <p>Tuple is one of the other flexible data type whcih is similar to list data type
            but only difference is  elements in tuple are enclosed in parenthesis ()
            the values in tuple cannot be upadted , they are only readble </p>
            <div class="myStyle">
             Syntax:
                myTuple = ("a", 1, 1.3, "Python")
                
                print(myTuple)  # print whole myTuple
                print(myTuple[1])  # print 2nd element i.e 1
                print(myTuple[1:3])  # print from 2nd to 3rd element in myList 
                myTuple[0] = 'Java'  # error
            </div>
        <li>Dictionary</li>
        <p>Dictionay is a other kind of data type which is used to strore key and value pairs and
        and it is defined with curly braces: {} </p>
        <div class="myStyle">
            Syntax:
            # Dictionary : Key value pairs 
            
            myDictionary = {'name': 'Python','creator': 'Guido van Rossum', 'born': '1980} 
            
            print(myDictionary['name']) # It prints the Python.
            print(myDictionary.keys()) # It prints all keys 
            print(myDictionary.values()) # It prints all values
        </div>
